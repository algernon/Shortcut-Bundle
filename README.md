# Shortcut Bundle

This is a complete, standalone example of a full port of [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope] to a single board: [Dygma][dygma]'s [Shortcut][shortcut] v0.4 prototype. The main objective is to demonstrate how to create a bundle of your own, with its own `boards.txt` and whatnot.

 [shortcut]: http://shortcut.gg/

Clone it, update the submodules, run `make`, and voila!
